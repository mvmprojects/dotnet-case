# Dotnet Case

This is a Web API demo project made using .NET Core 3.1, to be combined with a front-end project for testing purposes. At the time of writing, the front-end demo project can be found over here: https://github.com/mvmprojects/angular-case 

The project is themed around a music store and so the database entities are Artist, Album and Track.

EF Core and Automapper will be used.

## Projects within Solution

Projects within the dotnet-case solution are API (default Web App template), BL and DATA for more separation (empty class library template) and finally TEST (NUnit template).
